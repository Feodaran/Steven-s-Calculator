# Steven-s-Calculator
I made a little calculator in C#. It's functional and I cleared it of errors. There are improvements to be made, though, mostly aesthetic.
I attempted to use Regex to validate the text box so that users could only enter numerical values and decimals, but I couldn't get it to work so I disabled the textbox.
User cannot enter more than 1 decimal. I fixed a number of other issues, too.
It's small and ugly, though, and it hasn't got an icon. That needs work, but it is functional.
