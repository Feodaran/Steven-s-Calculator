# Steven-s-Calculator
I made a little calculator in C#. It's functional and I cleared it of errors. There are improvements to be made, though, mostly aesthetic. <br/><br/>
I attempted to use Regex to validate the text box so that users could only enter numerical values and decimals, but I couldn't get it to work so I disabled the textbox.<br/><br/>
User cannot enter more than 1 decimal. I fixed a number of other issues, too.</br><br/>
It's small and ugly, though, and it hasn't got an icon. That needs work, but it is functional. <br/><br/>

Setup.exe and Steven's Calculator.application both seem to do the same thing, though Setup.exe is probably the right one. They both open the program straight away. I may have missed something while publishing. <br/> <br/>

I did this with Visual Studio 2017 (free version).
